# The betterplace Engineering Culture

These are the shared values of the betterplace.org engineering team. They exist in addition to the betterplace values of _trust_, _appreciation_ and _commitment_. Members of the engineering team are invited to work on these values in order to keep them coherent with our daily work.

## We have solid engineering standards

## We help each other grow

## We feel responsible for our code and users

## We are agile

## We encourage experimentation

All betterplace developers and engineers can create pull requests to update this document. Those PR can be edited by all of them. 

The PR can be merged by a simple majority vote (e.g. via 👍). Voting is 10 working days from the creation of the pull request. At least 3 people must actively upvote the request for it to be merged.

Any engineer can veto/raise a red flag on a pull request (e.g. via ❌ or 🚩). A red flag _must_ be explained. A red flag means that the PR cannot be merged and will go into an in-person team discussion.
